SnakeComp is an AI competition based on the popular snake game. By implementing 
the SnakeControl interface (deciding in each turn in which direction a snake 
moves), participants can submit their snake control and let several snakes 
compete with each other.

Make sure that your implementation of the SnakeControl interface belongs to the 
control.samples package.
